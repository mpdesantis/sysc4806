## Description
SYSC 4806A Lab 6 Submission.

## Configuration
The code submitted here was developed and compiled on an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS machine with the folowing Java versions:
```bash
$ java --version
openjdk 21.0.4 2024-07-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 21.0.4+7-Ubuntu-1ubuntu222.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0.4+7-Ubuntu-1ubuntu222.04, mixed mode, sharing)
```

## Usage
Run the `AddressBookJpaApplication.java` static `main()` method. You can then issue some HTTP requests via `curl` (a few examples provided in `json/` directory), and view a WebUI page using a Thymeleaf template at `http://localhost:8080/addressbooks?name=<name-of-addressbook>` (you can quickly view an example at `http://localhost:8080/addressbooks?name=My+Persistent+AddressBook` if you like).


## Notes
Thanks!!
